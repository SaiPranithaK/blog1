    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computer systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks, unauthorized access, and damage. In today’s digital landscape, where data is more valuable and vulnerable than ever, cybersecurity is a critical field aimed at protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. This protection spans a wide array of sectors, including government, healthcare, finance, and individual users, all of whom rely on secure digital infrastructure to function effectively.
        The primary goal of cybersecurity is to secure data and information systems from various cyber threats, such as hacking, phishing, ransomware, and data breaches. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, with attackers using sophisticated techniques to exploit system vulnerabilities, steal sensitive information, or disrupt operations. Cybersecurity involves not only technology and software defenses but also includes policies, risk management, user awareness, and incident response strategies.There are several types of cybersecurity that focus on different areas of protection. Network security safeguards the infrastructure of networks by monitoring traffic and implementing firewalls,encryption, and other access controls to prevent intrusions.Information security focuses on protecting the integrity and privacy of data in storage and transmission.Application security is aimed at securing software applications by identifying and patching vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of safeguarding computers, servers, networks, and data from malicious attacks. As the digital world grows, cybersecurity becomes crucial for preventing unauthorized access, theft, or damage to information systems. Cybersecurity is not just important for businesses; it’s equally essential for individuals, governments, and society as a whole.Cybersecurity is essential as digital threats continue to evolve and affect individuals, organizations, and governments. Proactive measures and constant monitoring are key to maintaining a secure digital environment.</p>

    <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters in Today's World</h2>
    <p>The digital transformation has brought incredible convenience, but it also increases the risk of cyber threats. Whether it's securing online transactions, protecting sensitive data, or ensuring that critical infrastructure runs smoothly, cybersecurity plays a vital role. Strong cybersecurity measures prevent threats like data breaches, financial losses, and even reputational damage.For organizations, a strong cybersecurity framework is critical to maintaining trust with clients and customers. Data breaches can erode public confidence, particularly when sensitive personal information is exposed. Furthermore, compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California, is legally required to ensure customer data privacy. Investing in cybersecurity is not only a measure of risk management but also a demonstration of responsibility and transparency, which can enhance an organization’s credibility.</p>
    <h2>Common Cybersecurity Threats</h2>
    <p>Cyber threats come in many forms. Here are some common types:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software, like viruses and spyware, that infects and damages systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent messages tricking people into revealing sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Malware that encrypts files and demands a ransom for their release.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Overloading systems to disrupt access and services.</li>
        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:</strong> Eavesdropping attacks that intercept communications between two parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Principles of Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity is built upon three core principles, often called the CIA Triad:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring data is accessible only to those authorized to see it.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Protecting data from being altered by unauthorized users.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring authorized users have access to data and resources when needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Protect Yourself Online</h2>
    <p>Adopting good security habits is essential for personal and professional safety. Here are some basic practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use strong, unique passwords for each account and update them regularly.</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible for an extra layer of protection.</li>
        <li>Be cautious when clicking links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</li>
        <li>Regularly update software and applications to fix security vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As technology evolves, so do cyber threats. Innovations like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are playing an increasing role in identifying and preventing cyberattacks. Additionally, the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud computing brings new challenges and emphasizes the need for advanced cybersecurity strategies.Cybersecurity has existed since the creation of the first computer virus in 1971.That was the “creeper” virus, a harmless application designed to replicate and move from computer to computer.  New malware is created every day, however, by “threat actors” who attempt to develop new tools for often-nefarious purposes. 
    Cybersecurity professionals attempt to stop them, each investing to out-perform the other, in what has become a cat-and-mouse game.In the decades sense, the sophistication on all sides in the game have increased.Ultimately, cybersecurity defense in depth strategy will not go away.  Organizations will never have one silver bullet to completely reduce the risk of a cyber-attack but rather multiple technologies and processes in place to help ensure those threats are minimized.</p>
  
    <h2>Watch a Cybersecurity Awareness Video</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity awareness is key to protection. Technology to be able to perform efficient cybersecurity tasks. It’s simply the result of scale.  Successful cyber will always boil down to people – skilled human minds playing the role of either the cat or the mouse. But there are too many things to watch, too many threat variants (there are easily more than a billion viruses today), too many vectors, too many targets. That must be simplified. Today, we’re already using machine learning and artificial intelligence to help make sense of all that noise before it gets presented to human security professionals.This video provides tips on staying safe online:</p>
